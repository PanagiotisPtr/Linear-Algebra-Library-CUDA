# Linear Algebra Library CUDA
Simple implementation of a Linear Algebra Library in CUDA

## How to run the code
The code is tested on linux ubuntu 16.04 with CUDA 8.0 and C++11
To run the code you will only need to get CUDA 8.0 installed and setup. And run the compile.sh script from the terminal.

Note: I do not have the nvcc compiler directory at the environment variables on my machine so if your directory is different 
make sure that you change it. Or if you already have nvcc on your environment variables you can remove it and just compile the 
main.cu file.

### About the Project

This is a very simple implementation of vector/matrix operations on the GPU. I am not an expert with CUDA so the code may not be (and probably isn't)
very efficient but it works.It mostly was an experimentation to see what it's like writing programs in CUDA.
The matrix operations include operations such as Determinant, Inverse and Cofactor of a matrix.

I hope that you will find the code helpful and educational.
